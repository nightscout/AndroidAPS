// Utility extension functions for clearer conversion between

// decimals. For basal values, the last 3 digits of an integer
// make up the decimal, so for example, 1568 actually means
// 1.568 IU, and 419 means 0.419 IU etc. Similarly, for bolus
// values, the last digit makes up the decimal. 57 means 5.7 IU,
// 4 means 0.4 IU etc.
// To emphasize better that such a conversion is taking place,
// these extension functions are put in place.

internal class RetryPermissionCheckException : ComboException("retry permission check")

// Utility function to perform Android permission checks before running a block.
// If the permissions are not given, wait for a little while, then retry.
// This is needed for AAPS<->combov2 integration, since AAPS can start combov2
// even _before_ the user granted AAPS BLUETOOTH_CONNECT etc. permissions.
//
// permissionsToCheckFor is a collection of permissions strings like
// Manifest.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN. The function goes through the collection,
// and checks each and every permission to see if they have all been granted.
// Only if all have been granted will the block be executed.
//
// It is possible that within the block, some additional permission checks
// are performed - in particular, these can be checks for permissions that
// weren't part of the permissionsToCheckFor collection. If such a permission
// is not granted, the block can throw AndroidBluetoothPermissionException.
// That exception also specifies what exact permissions haven't been granted
// (yet). runWithPermissionCheck() then adds these missing permissions to
// permissionsToCheckFor, and tries its permission check again, this time
// with these extra permissions included. That way, a failed permission
// check within the block does not break anything, and instead, these
// permissions too are re-checked by the same logic as the one that looks
// at the initially specified permissions.
//
// Additionally, the block might perform other checks that are not directly
// permissions but related to them. One example is a check to see if the
// Bluetooth adapter is enabled in addition to checking for Bluetooth
// permissions. When such custom checks fail, they can throw
// RetryPermissionCheckException to inform this function that it should
// retry its run, just as if a permission hadn't been granted.
