/**
 * Class for high-level Combo pump IO.
 *
 * This implements high level IO actions on top of [TransportLayer.IO].
 * It takes care of pairing, connection setup, remote terminal (RT)
 * commands and RT display reception, and also supports the Combo's
 * command mode. Basically, this class' public API reflects what the
 * user can directly do with the pump (press RT buttons like UP or
 * DOWN, send a command mode bolus etc.).
 *
 * For initiating the Combo pairing, the [performPairing] function is
 * available. This must not be used if a connection was already established
 * via [connect] - pairing is only possible in the disconnected state.
 *
 * For initiating a regular connection, use [connect]. Do not call
 * [connect] again until after disconnecting with [disconnect]. Also
 * see the remarks above about pairing and connecting at the same time.
 *
 * The Combo regularly sends new display frames when running in the
 * REMOTE_TERMINAL (RT) mode. These frames come as the payload of
 * RT_DISPLAY packets. This class reads those packets and extracts the
 * partial frames (the packets only contain portions of a frame, not
 * a full frame). Once enough parts were gathered to assemble a full
 * frame, the frame is emitted via [onNewDisplayFrame]. This callback
 * must not block, since this would otherwise block the dataflow in the
 * internal IO code. This callback is mainly meant for passing the
 * frame to something like a flow or a channel. If its argument is
 * null, it means that there's no frame available. This happens at
 * the beginning in [connect] and during the [switchMode] call.
 *
 * To handle IO at the transport layer, this uses [TransportLayer.IO]
 * internally.
 *
 * In regular connections, the Combo needs "heartbeats" to periodically
 * let it know that the client still exists. If too much time passes since
 * the last heartbeat, the Combo terminates the connection. Each mode has a
 * different type of heartbeat: RT mode has RT_KEEP_ALIVE commands, command
 * mode has CMD_PING commands. To periodically send these, this class runs
 * separate coroutines with loops inside that send these commands. Only one
 * of these two heartbeats are active, depending on the current mode of the
 * Combo.
 * Note that other commands sent to the Combo _also_ count as heartbeats,
 * so RT_KEEP_ALIVE / CMD_PING only need to be sent by the internal heartbeat
 * if no other command has been sent for a while now.
 * In some cases (typically unit tests), a regular connection without
 * a heartbeat is needed. [connect] accepts an argument to start
 * without one for this purpose.
 *
 * The supplied [pumpStateStore] is used during pairing and regular
 * connections. During pairing, a new pump state is set up for the
 * pump that is being paired. It is during pairing that the invariant
 * portion of the pump state is written. During regular (= not pairing)
 * connections, the invariant part is read, not written.
 *
 * This class accesses the pump state in a thread safe manner, ensuring
 * that no two threads access the pump state at the same time. See
 * [PumpStateStore] for details about thread safety.
 *
 * @param pumpStateStore Pump state store to use.
 * @param bluetoothDevice [BluetoothDevice] object to use for
 *   Bluetooth I/O. Must be in a disconnected state when
 *   assigned to this instance.
 * @param onNewDisplayFrame Callback to invoke whenever a new RT
 *   [DisplayFrame] was received.
 * @param onPacketReceiverException Callback to invoked whenever an
 *   exception is thrown inside the transport layer's receiver loop.
 *   This is useful for automatic reconnecting.

    /**
     * Establishes a regular connection.
     *
     * A "regular connection" is a connection that is used for typical Combo
     * operations such as sending bolus commands, sending RT button presses etc.
     * The client must have been paired with the Combo before such connections
     * can be established.
     *
     * This function suspends the calling coroutine until the connection is up
     * and running or a connection setup error occurs, which will cause an
     * exception to be thrown. If this happens, users must call [disconnect]
     * before doing anything else again with this [PumpIO] instance.
     *
     * The Bluetooth connection is set up by this function. [connectionState]
     * is updated by it as well, as is the [connectProgressReporter] that is
     * passed to this function as an argument.
     *
     * This must be called before [switchMode] and any RT / command mode
     * function are used.
     *
     * Transport layer packets are received in a background coroutine that is part
     * of an internal coroutine scope. Reception is handled by [TransportLayer.IO].
     *
     * [isIORunning] will return true if the connection was established.
     *
     * [disconnect] is the counterpart to this function. It terminates
     * an existing connection and stops the worker.
     *
     * This also starts the "heartbeat" (unless explicitly requested not to).
     * See the [PumpIO] documentation above for details.
     *
     * The [connectionState] is set to [ConnectionState.FAILED] in case of
     * an exception, unless it is a [CancellationException], in which case
     * this function performs a normal disconnection by calling [disconnect].
     *
     * If the [connectProgressReporter] isn't null, progress is reported through
     * it to the caller. The [BasicProgressStage.Aborted] (and its subclasses),
     * [BasicProgressStage.Finished], and [BasicProgressStage.Cancelled] stages
     * are _not_ set; this is up to the caller. Likewise, the progress reporter
     * is not automatically reset; if it requires a reset, the caller must do
     * that by calling [ProgressReporter.reset]. This is done that way because
     * the caller may implement some mechanism to retry a connection attempt;
     * in such a case, setting these stages and resetting the reported would
     * interfere, so this is not done. The [connectProgressReporter] must contain
     * the [BasicProgressStage.PerformingConnectionHandshake] stage in its
     * planned progress sequence (see [ProgressReporter] for details).
     *
     * This function also handles a special situation if the [Nonce] that is
     * stored in [PumpStateStore] for this pump is incorrect. The Bluetooth
     * socket can then be successfully connected, but right afterwards, when
     * this function tries to send a [TransportLayer.Command.REQUEST_REGULAR_CONNECTION]
     * packet, the Combo does not respond, instead terminating the connection
     * and producing a [BluetoothException]. If this happens, this function
     * increments the nonce and tries again. This is done multiple times
     * until either the connection setup succeeds or the maximum number of
     * attempts is reached. In the latter case, this function throws a
     * [ConnectionRequestIsNotBeingAcceptedException]. The user should then
     * be recommended to re-pair with the Combo, since establishing a connection
     * isn't working.
     *
     * @param initialMode What mode to initially switch to.
     * @param runHeartbeat True if the heartbeat shall be started.
     * @param connectProgressReporter Optional [ProgressReporter] to update
     *   during the connection progress.
     * @throws ConnectionRequestIsNotBeingAcceptedException if connecting the
     *   actual Bluetooth socket succeeds, but the Combo does not accept the
     *   packet that requests a connection, and this failed several times
     *   in a row.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if IO was already started by a previous
     *   [connect] call or if the [PumpStateStore] that was passed to the
     *   class constructor has no pairing data for this pump (most likely
     *   because the pump isn't paired yet).
